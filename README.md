# LangChain Examples
Here are some examples of using langchain and streamlit to create some interactive apps using LLMs from Hugging Face. You can find a question-answer chatbot that allows you to uplaod your own pdf, a general chatbot using LLMs and prompt, and several other use-cases.

In order to use the code you will need to sign up for an account at <a href="https://huggingface.co/">https://huggingface.co/</a> and create a pair of API tokens. Once created, you can save them in a json file and set it to your environment with os.environ['HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN']. Feel free to take a look and have some fun with the code!
